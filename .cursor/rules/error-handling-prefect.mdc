# Error Handling Guidelines for Prefect Workflows

- Use Prefect's built-in retry mechanisms:
  - Configure retries with `@task(retries=N)` or `@flow(retries=N)`.
  - Set retry delays using `retry_delay_seconds`.
- Log errors using Prefect's logging system to track task states and failures.
- Organize workflows into smaller tasks to improve fault tolerance and allow granular retries.
- Use Prefect's state management tools (e.g., `set_state`) to handle task failures gracefully.
- Avoid using `try`/`except` blocks inside Prefect tasks unless absolutely necessary; rely on Prefect's orchestration features instead.
