# Error Handling Guidelines for Python Scripts

- Use `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Log meaningful error messages for debugging purposes using the `logging` module.
- Avoid catching generic exceptions (`Exception`) unless absolutely necessary; prefer catching specific exceptions.
- Use `finally` blocks to clean up resources (e.g., closing database connections or file handles).
- Raise custom exceptions when needed to improve clarity and debugging.
