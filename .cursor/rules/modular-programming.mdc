# Modular Programming Guidelines

## General Principles

- Break down code into separate, interchangeable modules.
- Each module should focus on one aspect of functionality (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Avoid copying code across files; create reusable modules and import them as needed.
- Ensure modules have high cohesion (functions within a module should be closely related).
- Minimize coupling between modules by using well-defined interfaces or abstractions.

## For Python Code

- Organize Python code into logical modules or packages.
- Use helper functions or utility modules for reusable logic.
- Follow Python's import conventions to avoid circular dependencies.
- Document each module with clear docstrings explaining its purpose and usage.
